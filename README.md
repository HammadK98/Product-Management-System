# Product-Management-System
Manage and sort through product inventory and group customers by what they buy.

The Product Management System allows for the creation of relations concerned with managing information stored with customers' consent, using this information to sort through the products bought by the customers and how much was paid for the said products.

The database created as such could be used to match customers to the products they bought, how much they bought them for. The user will also be able to sort through the customerâ€™s age and match who buys what the most. It could also be used to know what products are bought the most, and what age group buys the said product the most.

As such, the database could be used to identify what items to stock the most and in what quantity, because the user, through the database's help, could identify what age group buys which product, and can prepare appropriately.
